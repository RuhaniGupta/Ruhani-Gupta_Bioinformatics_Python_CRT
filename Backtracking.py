'''A backtracking algorithm is a problem-solving algorithm that uses a brute force approac for finding the desaired output'''

'''A brute force approach tries out all the possible solutions and chooses the  best solutions'''

'''The term backtracking suggests that if the current solution is not suitable,then backtrack and try other solutions.Thus,recursion is used in
this approach'''

'''Types of problems

Decision Problem : In this, we search for a feasible solution.

Optimization Problem : In this, we search for the best solution.

Enumeration Problem : In this, we find all feasible solutions.'''


'''In recursion, the function call itself until it reaches a base cas. In backtracking, we recursion to explore all the possibilities until we 
get the get result for the problem.'''
