'''A graph is a pair G=(V,E) where V is a set whose elements are called vertices and E is a set of vertices,
whose elements are called edges.
The vertices x and y of an edge are called endpoints of the edges.The edge is said to be join x and y and to 
be incident on x and y.A vertex may not belong to any edge.'''
